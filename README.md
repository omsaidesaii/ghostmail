## üöÄ Getting Started

Getting GhostMail up and running locally is super easy!

### Prerequisites

All you need is a modern web browser. Since it's a client-side app, you don't need any complex server setup.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/omsaidesaii/ghostmail.git](https://github.com/omsaidesaii/ghostmail.git)
    ```
2.  **Move into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ghostmail
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser, and you're good to go!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works Under the Hood

GhostMail runs entirely in your browser. It talks to the **Guerrilla Mail API** to manage your temporary emails:

1.  **Email Generation:** When you open the page or click "New Email," GhostMail sends a request to the Guerrilla Mail API to get a fresh temporary email address and a session ID (`sid_token`).
2.  **Message Retrieval:** The app regularly checks the Guerrilla Mail API, using your unique `sid_token`, to see if any new messages have arrived in your temporary inbox.
3.  **Content Display:** If you click on an email in your inbox, another API call fetches the full content of that specific message, displaying it in a neat pop-up.

This setup means GhostMail doesn't store your email data itself; it relies completely on the Guerrilla Mail service for all email handling.

## ‚û°Ô∏è How to Use

1.  **Get Your Email:** When you first open the page, a temporary email address will automatically appear in the main input field.
2.  **Copy It:** Click the **"Copy"** button next to the email address to save it to your clipboard.
3.  **Use It Anywhere:** Use this temporary email address on any website or service where you'd rather not use your real one.
4.  **Check Your Inbox:** Any emails sent to your temporary address will show up in the "Inbox" section below. The inbox refreshes automatically every 10 minutes, or you can click the **"Refresh"** button for an instant check.
5.  **Read Messages:** Click on any message in the inbox to open a modal and view its full content.
6.  **New Email:** Want a different email? Click the **"New Email"** button. This will generate a fresh address, reset the timer, and clear your current inbox.
7.  **Clear All:** Use the **"Clear All"** button in the inbox controls to remove all messages from the displayed inbox. (Note: this only clears your local view, not the actual emails on the Guerrilla Mail servers).
8.  **Change Theme:** Click the moon/sun icon in the header to switch between the sleek **dark mode** and a bright **light mode**.
